Project-1 Case Study Article on Restaurant business 
In this project, we designed a database for a restaurant, organizing tables like Customers, Reservations, Orders, Menu_Items, Payments. We defined the relationships between these tables (such as one-to-many and many-to-many), created sample data, and showed how to query important metrics like total sales for a specific day. The database structure helps manage customer interactions, order processing, and inventory, ensuring smooth restaurant operations.
