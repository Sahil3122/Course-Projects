Project-1 Case Study Article on Restaurant business 

In this project, I designed a database for a restaurant, organizing tables like Customers, Reservations, Orders, Menu_Items, Payments. I defined the relationships between these tables (such as one-to-many and many-to-many), created sample data, and showed how to query important metrics like total sales for a specific day. The database structure helps manage customer interactions, order processing, and inventory, ensuring smooth restaurant operations.[learn more](https://github.com/Sahil3122/Course-Projects/blob/main/Case%20Study%20Article%20on%20Restaurant%20.pdf)

Project-2 Report on Analytic Solution of NYC Taxi Fare

In this project, I analyzed a taxi trip dataset to uncover important trends and insights. I focused on key metrics like total revenue, trip volume, on-time performance, and average trip duration. Using Power BI, I created visualizations, including bar graphs and pie charts, to highlight the busiest days, top vendors, and trip status. The analysis helped identify patterns in taxi service efficiency and demand.[learn more](https://github.com/Sahil3122/Course-Projects/blob/main/Report%20on%20Analytic%20Solution%20of%20NYC%20Taxi%20Fare.pdf)

Project-3 Cloud Architecture For Smart Farm “AgriTech Farms” 

In this project, I created a cloud-based solution for smart farming. I collected data from IoT sensors, weather APIs, mobile apps, and inventory systems. The data was processed using Azure tools like IoT Hub, Data Lake, and Stream Analytics to provide real-time insights. I built Power BI dashboards to help farmers track crop health, manage inventory, and plan better. This system makes farming more efficient and data-driven.

Project 4:- Power Bi Dashboard for hotel booking

In this project, I analyzed hotel booking data to identify key metrics such as total revenue, cancellation rate, and revenue by market segment. I created two dashboards: one for operational insights, highlighting bookings, revenue trends, and cancellations, and another for market segment analysis. Finally, I developed an Executive Dashboard summarizing overall performance with key KPIs to support strategic decision-making.

Project 5:- YYC DataCon 2025 – Insights on Visual Storytelling

This repository contains key takeaways from YYC DataCon 2025, focusing on the power of visual storytelling in data communication. Hosted by Hot Neon Learning, the event explored structured frameworks, creative design, and emotional engagement to make data more impactful. Discover insights, resources, and techniques to transform complex data into compelling narratives.[learn more](https://github.com/Sahil3122/Course-Projects/blob/main/YYC_DataCon_2025_Blog-1.pdf)

Final Project:- “HealWise” Drug Prediction Using Patient Data

This project aims to help doctors choose the right drug for patients using machine learning. By analyzing health data like age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol, and sodium-to-potassium ratio, a model can predict the most suitable medicine. The Random Forest Classifier was used and gave 100% accuracy, making it the best choice. The project helps reduce prescription errors and saves time in hospitals. Data was taken from Kaggle, and various machine learning techniques were tested. HealWise can be used in clinics, health apps, and telemedicine platforms to support faster and smarter drug recommendations.[learn more](https://github.com/Sahil3122/Course-Projects/blob/main/HealWise.pdf).
