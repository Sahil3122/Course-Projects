Project-1 Case Study Article on Restaurant business 

In this project, I designed a database for a restaurant, organizing tables like Customers, Reservations, Orders, Menu_Items, Payments. I defined the relationships between these tables (such as one-to-many and many-to-many), created sample data, and showed how to query important metrics like total sales for a specific day. The database structure helps manage customer interactions, order processing, and inventory, ensuring smooth restaurant operations.[learn more](https://github.com/Sahil3122/Course-Projects/blob/main/Case%20Study%20Article%20on%20Restaurant%20.pdf)

Project-2 Report on Analytic Solution of NYC Taxi Fare

In this project, I analyzed a taxi trip dataset to uncover important trends and insights. I focused on key metrics like total revenue, trip volume, on-time performance, and average trip duration. Using Power BI, I created visualizations, including bar graphs and pie charts, to highlight the busiest days, top vendors, and trip status. The analysis helped identify patterns in taxi service efficiency and demand.[learn more](https://github.com/Sahil3122/Course-Projects/blob/main/Report%20on%20Analytic%20Solution%20of%20NYC%20Taxi%20Fare.pdf)

Project-3 Cloud Architecture For Smart Farm “AgriTech Farms” 

In this project, I created a cloud-based solution for smart farming. I collected data from IoT sensors, weather APIs, mobile apps, and inventory systems. The data was processed using Azure tools like IoT Hub, Data Lake, and Stream Analytics to provide real-time insights. I built Power BI dashboards to help farmers track crop health, manage inventory, and plan better. This system makes farming more efficient and data-driven.

Project 4:- Power Bi Dashboard for hotel booking

In this project, I analyzed hotel booking data to identify key metrics such as total revenue, cancellation rate, and revenue by market segment. I created two dashboards: one for operational insights, highlighting bookings, revenue trends, and cancellations, and another for market segment analysis. Finally, I developed an Executive Dashboard summarizing overall performance with key KPIs to support strategic decision-making.
