Project-1 Case Study Article on Restaurant business 

In this project, I designed a database for a restaurant, organizing tables like Customers, Reservations, Orders, Menu_Items, Payments. I defined the relationships between these tables (such as one-to-many and many-to-many), created sample data, and showed how to query important metrics like total sales for a specific day. The database structure helps manage customer interactions, order processing, and inventory, ensuring smooth restaurant operations.[learn more](https://github.com/Sahil3122/Course-Projects/blob/main/Case%20Study%20Article%20on%20Restaurant%20.pdf)

Project-2 Report on Analytic Solution of NYC Taxi Fare

In this project, I analyzed a taxi trip dataset to uncover important trends and insights. I focused on key metrics like total revenue, trip volume, on-time performance, and average trip duration. Using Power BI, I created visualizations, including bar graphs and pie charts, to highlight the busiest days, top vendors, and trip status. The analysis helped identify patterns in taxi service efficiency and demand.
